# World Cup 2026 - Immediate's Team Draw Website

This is the Immediate website for the 2026 World Cup games.

Here you could register and contribute a small sum (£5) to a shared pot and get random assignment of a team out of the 32 countries participating. Whoever's team is the winner will get the whole amount.

The website will also provide details on the different matches in the different stages of the tournament, from the group stage all the way to the final.

## Login

To login, you'll need to enter your registered email address in the login form. A verification email will be sent with a code (which expires after 10 minutes) to the registered email inbox with a 6 digit code. You'll need to enter it into the form and only then you will be able to login (once logged in, you won't need to login again on that browser, unless you clear your cookies).

Example of the email you'll get:

Once the code is verified, you'll see what country you've been drawn (it's fully randomised and even I don't know what country you're given) and the amount in the prize pot.

### Group Stage

In the group stage screen you can view the tables and all of the teams in the tournament plus all of the matches that they'll have with the dates of the match.

The tables are ordered according to the FIFA ranking when they drew it. The ranking afterwards will be determined by the result of the matches they played, and the points are calculated according to the FIFA regulations (if 2 teams have the same points, their ranking in the group will be determined by goal aggregate).

<img src="docs/images/group-stage-table.png" alt="Group Stage Table">

If you hover over the official FIFA 3 letter name code, you can see the name of the country.

On the matchday section, you can see the whole group stage matches and the dates. You could also see what team won, lost and had a draw.
